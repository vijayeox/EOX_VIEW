The checklist is as follows:&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>1: REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT ANALYSIS<\\/strong>: It is the first thing any QA Team does, Requirement Document. It tops our checklist too. The requirement document is a formal document which puts forth the requirements of the client and checks whether the requirements are met by the product. It will be mainly used in the preparation of test cases and procedures for the product.It is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software.It also contains non-functional requirements like the design, UI etc.<\\/p>\\n\\n<ol type=\\\"1\\\">\\n\\t<li>a.&nbsp;<strong>Read up what is required to be done<\\/strong>. Understand WHAT the avatar is going to be doing when they use this functionality and how the functionality will provide them value. With this in mind see&nbsp;how aesthetically the screen should look to the end user (Example: first thing I should see as an avatar). My goal is to make sure that the avatar should see the thing that they are supposed to see first. For example, if I am going to test the functionality of a list view, then the goal of the avatar is to do something with the names of the items in the list view.&nbsp;I will see if my attention falls&nbsp;on the names.&nbsp;<\\/li>\\n<\\/ol>\\n\\n<p><strong>2: PNSF<\\/strong>: Our abbreviation for Positive Negative Success Failure This is a trial and error method, run by a tester to test a product. In positive testing,the test is carried out with positive perceptions in other words testing is carried out on the module taking input values which match the customer requirements.We give various valid combinations of input.Negative Testing is carried with negative perceptions in other words testing carried out on the module taking input values which do not match the customer requirements. We give invalid combinations of input.This helps to see it the quality of output is met as per requirement.We could graphically represent it like:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\\\"\\/data\\/uploads\\/organization\\/1\\/userfiles\\/testin_graph.JPG\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>3: INTEGRATION TESTING<\\/strong>: This definitely asks for hard core testing knowledge.It is an extension of unit testing. Two units which are actually tested are combined together and the interface between them is tested. Integration testing tells us which click navigates to which page and if its going according to the required page. Ok, this for sure needs the tester to know his product right. If she\\/he is not sure of it, the testing fails.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>4: BROWSER TEST<\\/strong>: It is important to test the product on various platforms. Sometimes, something which works right in Google Chrome might not work the same in Firefox. Well, that is not how our product should be. It should give the same result everywhere. The client has the liberty to use my product in any browser.So we got to get it right in Chrome, Mac, Firefox,Edge browsers.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>5: SPELL CHECK<\\/strong>: If you work with Microsoft Word, take advantage of the spellchecker. There are a few spelling and grammar checkers online, but if you are already proficient at spelling and grammar, the paid ones are of very little help. Its time to get back to school once again to get our dictation test right. The least we would want, is to have a client pick spelling errors in our product!<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>6: SEMANTICS<\\/strong>: Lets now get down to how much sense our product makes to the user. Everything the UI shows it should help user understand the product better without any ambiguity. The data shown in every part of the product should make complete sense to the user.Semantic testing is a technique with a goal to test the relationship with the data. The relationship can exist in three different ways:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Relationship between input data on 1 screen<\\/li>\\n\\t<li>Relationship between input data on different screens<\\/li>\\n\\t<li>Relationship between input data on data already existing in the system<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>We would not want to have a Save icon to not even save a document or a Delete icon saving the document!<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>7: DILU&nbsp;DAY IN THE LIFE OF A USER<\\/strong>: Its time to get into the shoes of a user. The tester is the user now, who has no knowledge of the product. She&nbsp;uses it like he is new to it to make sure its user-friendly. This helps the tester find small loopholes which might have been over-looked in all the rigorous testing methods.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>8: MOBILE TESTING<\\/strong>: Mobile technology is so vast now, that anything on a computer is available on a phone. Its not only for calls, its a computer! So now the tester checks how compatible the product is on various available platforms like Android, Windows, iphone, Ipad. The product needs to be tested on various platform to check.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>T9: STAGING<\\/strong>: A duplicate of the product is tested in staging. The all the various methods of testing is tried out on the product for its performance, quality and assurance.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>10: PRODUCTION<\\/strong>: The last step is to test the product in production. Here you will test the money features and F2C workflows!&nbsp;This is the last for us to make sure things are working as designed to help our customers gain value from the product. After the product is ready to go-live! Please make sure that you DO NOT have any test cases in production. Please make sure that all data is only the live customer data.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>11: <strong>Validation and verification process<\\/strong>:&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>$[6580260!details]<\\/p>\\n\\n<h1><strong>Workflow:<\\/strong><\\/h1>\\n\\n<p>The QA Process at VA follows a certain procedure.&nbsp;The process is put into a&nbsp;flowchart.

You will see in the image above the font size of the items in the &#39;Name&#39; column&nbsp;has been increased,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;the attention falls&nbsp;on the plus button and the status. A solution could be to make those items in bold in addition to the increased font to get one&#39;s immediate attention. This is a&nbsp;<strong><em>Bug 1.<\\/em><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Step 2<\\/strong> :&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is it making the person to take the right action towards the product?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>In the example above the right action is to make sure that they look at the details of a task. The plus sign is doing a good job here. The down arrow here is to make sure that they have action buttons that can work on the list view. This is not obvious. This needs to be taught or we need to have a tool tip otherwise the UI is not intuitive. I will file a bug on this to add a tool tip.&nbsp;<em><strong>Bug 2.<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Whenever the new requirements have been&nbsp;made one has to make sure that it has been given as a help document and is provided in all forms.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Step 3<\\/strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Next we&nbsp;should turn our attention on the Fonts, Alignments and the Basic UI layout of the product and match its consistency with the guidelines of the product<\\/strong>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Let us examine the example above.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>1. Fonts are consistent. Good.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>2. Alignment is not okay on the ID. All numbers should be right aligned. <em><strong>Bug 3.1<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>3.

This is critical.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>First, the search result list screen:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eoxvantage.com\\/data\\/uploads\\/organization\\/1\\/userfiles\\/2013_12_22_04_13_05.png\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Then, the assigned to list screen:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eoxvantage.com\\/data\\/uploads\\/organization\\/1\\/userfiles\\/2013_12_22_04_14_04.png\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>These two screens look very different,&nbsp;which is the right one?&nbsp;We need to talk to the design and product management team to check and&nbsp;make sure which is the right one. All of them should look the same, in fact all of them should be coming from the same piece of code, so as&nbsp;one is changed the other gets changed too. We should do white box testing to make sure that everything is coming from the same code base.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong><em>Bug 4.<\\/em><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Step 5<\\/strong> : &nbsp;<strong>Banner views wherever required to be added<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For example: In &quot;photo&quot; apps, there is no use&nbsp;of the &quot;attachment&quot; icon provided.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Step&nbsp;6<\\/strong> :&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Test the screen starting from top of the page to the bottom<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>I noticed that the &#39;show&#39; and &#39;hide&#39; columns is the only thing on the screen that has a text based button and not an image. Can we convert this into an image and make these&nbsp;columns as a mouse over when an avatar moves his or her mouse over the icon? <strong><em>Bug #5.1<\\/em><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Now finally it is time to click buttons and test the functionality. When you are pressing the buttons please pay special attention to the number of clicks and ease of use.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For example in this screen that we are looking at you have to press on the arrow below to see the number of comments on the message. Can we get this number like how we had before on the view itself,&nbsp;where it is visible without any click of a button?&nbsp;People have interest in tasks that have updates or comments,&nbsp;that is the nature of the task. That said, you must&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;to the development and the design team that they can have the comments elsewhere either in the list view main page itself. <em><strong>Would this bug #5.2<\\/strong><\\/em><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>When I look at the number of elements listed it only shows&nbsp;10 but the page size itself is very long and when I select 25 or 50 it seems to improve the sizing.

Can we please get a resolution on this?&nbsp;<strong><em>Bug 5.3<\\/em><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Please see that the Comment Chat is over the top of the pagination which&nbsp;makes pagination difficult to use.

At this time we know that this is already a bug that is reported to the development team.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Now it is time to follow the QA SOP to make sure that we follow all the other issues that we have to review in the Check Points including&nbsp;browser testing etc.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>The QA team has to test in all browsers:&nbsp;Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, iPad and mobile testing, as well as&nbsp;test sites such as&nbsp;localhost, insurance kpo, staging and production.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Ideally for every functionality you will find at least 10 to 15 if you do your job correctly and follow the steps recommended here.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Remember you are doing an important job. You are the last stop between the customer and us. Your attention to detail is critical in ensuring that the customer and therefore us do well. Please don&#39;t hesitate if you are doing the right thing. If you have questions,&nbsp;please ask and<strong>&nbsp;don&#39;t ever assume<\\/strong>. If you do assume,&nbsp;please make sure that you list out all your assumptions in the bug.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Step 9 <\\/strong>: <strong>Testing the functionalities across different server instances<\\/strong>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Testing the functionalities across different instances plays a crucial role in testing. Normally when a new function is introduced, it will be tested for one instance and will not be tested in other instances. Even though the functionality is working fine in one instance there may be chance of it not working or breaking the functionality in another instance .<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Example:&nbsp;Next action date column is added in all forms, it is working fine in all forms in Vantage Agora, Pierian and Chemizol organization, but when we click on the&nbsp;tickets module in Chemizol organization, the functionality was looking weird because of an&nbsp;extra column: &quot;check Box&quot;.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>So whenever a new functionality is introduced and&nbsp;regression testing is done, it should also be tested across all organizations.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>If the new requirements are given to developer, the&nbsp;developer firstly has to fix it accordingly. It then&nbsp;has to be assigned to the tester, who&nbsp;has to test the functionality thoroughly in the initial round and report to the developer if they are facing any issue.&nbsp;Even after fixing the issue, it will then be assigned to the QA. The QA&nbsp;has to test the functionality again and&nbsp;if the same issue persists again it is said that developer has to lose the kra.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Example 2:&nbsp;<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>These are the possible&nbsp;scenarios to test Email notifications:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>1) Put switch On to both Assigned and owner of form and send comments.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>2) Put switch On to owner and Off to Assigned person&nbsp;and send comments.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>3) Put switch Off to owner and On to Assigned person.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>4) Put switch Off to both user.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>5) Put switch Off to both user and login with third user whose switch is On.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>6)&nbsp;Put switch Off to both user and login with third user whose switch is Off.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Example 3:&nbsp;<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Functional testing example:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>1) Initially when the QA starts testing the functionality one has to make sure if its related to admin functionality has to test&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>2) When the ticket is raised give the snapshot related to admin in the same ticket.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the way QA should test admin as well.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The tester should also cross check other tester functionality.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Example 4:&nbsp;<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Beyond testing to purpose:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Create a parent ticket for each release and each group (Category):&nbsp;<\\/strong>Initially, one has to create a ticket which is considered to be the parent. When further&nbsp;tickets are raised, these should be linked to the parent.

The checklist is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1: REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT ANALYSIS</strong>: It is the first thing any QA Team does, Requirement Document. It tops our checklist too. The requirement document is a formal document which puts forth the requirements of the client and checks whether the requirements are met by the product. It will be mainly used in the preparation of test cases and procedures for the product.It is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software.It also contains non-functional requirements like the design, UI etc.</p>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\t<li>a.&nbsp;<strong>Read up what is required to be done</strong>. Understand WHAT the avatar is going to be doing when they use this functionality and how the functionality will provide them value. With this in mind see&nbsp;how aesthetically the screen should look to the end user (Example: first thing I should see as an avatar). My goal is to make sure that the avatar should see the thing that they are supposed to see first. For example, if I am going to test the functionality of a list view, then the goal of the avatar is to do something with the names of the items in the list view.&nbsp;I will see if my attention falls&nbsp;on the names.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>2: PNSF</strong>: Our abbreviation for Positive Negative Success Failure This is a trial and error method, run by a tester to test a product. In positive testing,the test is carried out with positive perceptions in other words testing is carried out on the module taking input values which match the customer requirements.We give various valid combinations of input.Negative Testing is carried with negative perceptions in other words testing carried out on the module taking input values which do not match the customer requirements. We give invalid combinations of input.This helps to see it the quality of output is met as per requirement.We could graphically represent it like:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\"/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/testin_graph.JPG\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>3: INTEGRATION TESTING</strong>: This definitely asks for hard core testing knowledge.It is an extension of unit testing. Two units which are actually tested are combined together and the interface between them is tested. Integration testing tells us which click navigates to which page and if its going according to the required page. Ok, this for sure needs the tester to know his product right. If she/he is not sure of it, the testing fails.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4: BROWSER TEST</strong>: It is important to test the product on various platforms. Sometimes, something which works right in Google Chrome might not work the same in Firefox. Well, that is not how our product should be. It should give the same result everywhere. The client has the liberty to use my product in any browser.So we got to get it right in Chrome, Mac, Firefox,Edge browsers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5: SPELL CHECK</strong>: If you work with Microsoft Word, take advantage of the spellchecker. There are a few spelling and grammar checkers online, but if you are already proficient at spelling and grammar, the paid ones are of very little help. Its time to get back to school once again to get our dictation test right. The least we would want, is to have a client pick spelling errors in our product!</p>\n\n<p><strong>6: SEMANTICS</strong>: Lets now get down to how much sense our product makes to the user. Everything the UI shows it should help user understand the product better without any ambiguity. The data shown in every part of the product should make complete sense to the user.Semantic testing is a technique with a goal to test the relationship with the data. The relationship can exist in three different ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Relationship between input data on 1 screen</li>\n\t<li>Relationship between input data on different screens</li>\n\t<li>Relationship between input data on data already existing in the system</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We would not want to have a Save icon to not even save a document or a Delete icon saving the document!</p>\n\n<p><strong>7: DILU&nbsp;DAY IN THE LIFE OF A USER</strong>: Its time to get into the shoes of a user. The tester is the user now, who has no knowledge of the product. She&nbsp;uses it like he is new to it to make sure its user-friendly. This helps the tester find small loopholes which might have been over-looked in all the rigorous testing methods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8: MOBILE TESTING</strong>: Mobile technology is so vast now, that anything on a computer is available on a phone. Its not only for calls, its a computer! So now the tester checks how compatible the product is on various available platforms like Android, Windows, iphone, Ipad. The product needs to be tested on various platform to check.</p>\n\n<p><strong>T9: STAGING</strong>: A duplicate of the product is tested in staging. The all the various methods of testing is tried out on the product for its performance, quality and assurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10: PRODUCTION</strong>: The last step is to test the product in production. Here you will test the money features and F2C workflows!&nbsp;This is the last for us to make sure things are working as designed to help our customers gain value from the product.

It&nbsp;is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/3_hggg.PNG\" /></p>\n\n<h1>Update process:</h1>\n\n<p>For every build cycle the quality team member has to update the tracker listed in the tracker link above. This will lead us to the your customer or product release as shown below:</p>\n\n<p>Every quality run for clients or releases will be associated with the build number. This will take to you the build form explained in the next section. The QA team member must make sure that these are updated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/6716588\"><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/86778_image.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Along with this clicking on the Client link will take you to the customer QC checklist.

When the report is updated it provides information as displayed below. This step has to be followed at the end of each build.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/quickedit/instanceformid/6716495\"><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/86777_image.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The list of Build reports can be found in here;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/listviewbyform/formid/2177/moduleid/96/type/apps\"><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/86776_image.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When the information is entered diligently in the build form the following operational intelligence can be achieved to provide visibility and control to the QA department.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/commatrix/commonmatrix/index/matrix/156/instanceformid/6605768/moduleid/28/wall/0\"><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/86775_image.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Example 1:&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/2013_12_22_04_04_10.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Read up the step 1. You will see in the image above the font size of the items in the &#39;Name&#39; column&nbsp;has been increased,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;the attention falls&nbsp;on the plus button and the status. A solution could be to make those items in bold in addition to the increased font to get one&#39;s immediate attention. This is a&nbsp;<strong><em>Bug 1.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong> :&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Is it making the person to take the right action towards the product?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the example above the right action is to make sure that they look at the details of a task. The plus sign is doing a good job here. The down arrow here is to make sure that they have action buttons that can work on the list view. This is not obvious. This needs to be taught or we need to have a tool tip otherwise the UI is not intuitive. I will file a bug on this to add a tool tip.&nbsp;<em><strong>Bug 2.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Whenever the new requirements have been&nbsp;made one has to make sure that it has been given as a help document and is provided in all forms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Next we&nbsp;should turn our attention on the Fonts, Alignments and the Basic UI layout of the product and match its consistency with the guidelines of the product</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Let us examine the example above.</p>\n\n<p>1. Fonts are consistent. Good.</p>\n\n<p>2. Alignment is not okay on the ID. All numbers should be right aligned. <em><strong>Bug 3.1</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>3. The arrow mark down is not aligned at the center. <strong><em>Bug 3.2</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>4. The columns to the right of Name have too much space while&nbsp;the Name column stays&nbsp;crowded. <em><strong>Bug 3.3</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>&nbsp;: &nbsp;<strong>Now it is time to compare the similar views/screens to make sure that there is consistency of design</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Remember up to this point we have not even touched the screen. This is critical.</p>\n\n<p>First, the search result list screen:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/2013_12_22_04_13_05.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then, the assigned to list screen:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/data/uploads/organization/1/userfiles/2013_12_22_04_14_04.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>These two screens look very different,&nbsp;which is the right one?&nbsp;We need to talk to the design and product management team to check and&nbsp;make sure which is the right one. All of them should look the same, in fact all of them should be coming from the same piece of code, so as&nbsp;one is changed the other gets changed too. We should do white box testing to make sure that everything is coming from the same code base.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Bug 4.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong> : &nbsp;<strong>Banner views wherever required to be added</strong></p>\n\n<p>For example: In &quot;photo&quot; apps, there is no use&nbsp;of the &quot;attachment&quot; icon provided.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step&nbsp;6</strong> :&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Test the screen starting from top of the page to the bottom</strong></p>\n\n<p>I noticed that the &#39;show&#39; and &#39;hide&#39; columns is the only thing on the screen that has a text based button and not an image. Can we convert this into an image and make these&nbsp;columns as a mouse over when an avatar moves his or her mouse over the icon? <strong><em>Bug #5.1</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Now finally it is time to click buttons and test the functionality. When you are pressing the buttons please pay special attention to the number of clicks and ease of use.</p>\n\n<p>For example in this screen that we are looking at you have to press on the arrow below to see the number of comments on the message. Can we get this number like how we had before on the view itself,&nbsp;where it is visible without any click of a button?&nbsp;People have interest in tasks that have updates or comments,&nbsp;that is the nature of the task. That said, you must&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;to the development and the design team that they can have the comments elsewhere either in the list view main page itself. <em><strong>Would this bug #5.2</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>When I look at the number of elements listed it only shows&nbsp;10 but the page size itself is very long and when I select 25 or 50 it seems to improve the sizing. Is there a way to fix this or is this a&nbsp;known error? Can we please get a resolution on this?&nbsp;<strong><em>Bug 5.3</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Please see that the Comment Chat is over the top of the pagination which&nbsp;makes pagination difficult to use. We need to change the position of the comment chat since most products have the pagination where we have it now. <em><strong>Bug 5.4</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong> :&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>One should also note that how easy is to use the product and&nbsp;number of clicks to execute the operations.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this case the product seems to be performing well but it seems that the update functionality is not consistent with the other updates on comment in the form edit - it is missing the assigned to person. This should be fixed list listed in the bug<a href=\"http:// https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/28181\" target=\"_self\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/28181\" target=\"_self\">https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/28181</a>&nbsp;<em><strong>Bug #6.1</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 8</strong> :&nbsp;<strong>Follow the same procedure across all the modules and the forms&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now looking at all other modules, the bugs remain consistent except for Assigned to and follow up. At this time we know that this is already a bug that is reported to the development team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Now it is time to follow the QA SOP to make sure that we follow all the other issues that we have to review in the Check Points including&nbsp;browser testing etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The QA team has to test in all browsers:&nbsp;Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, iPad and mobile testing, as well as&nbsp;test sites such as&nbsp;localhost, insurance kpo, staging and production.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ideally for every functionality you will find at least 10 to 15 if you do your job correctly and follow the steps recommended here.</p>\n\n<p>Remember you are doing an important job. You are the last stop between the customer and us. Your attention to detail is critical in ensuring that the customer and therefore us do well. Please don&#39;t hesitate if you are doing the right thing. If you have questions,&nbsp;please ask and<strong>&nbsp;don&#39;t ever assume</strong>. If you do assume,&nbsp;please make sure that you list out all your assumptions in the bug.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 9 </strong>: <strong>Testing the functionalities across different server instances</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Testing the functionalities across different instances plays a crucial role in testing. Normally when a new function is introduced, it will be tested for one instance and will not be tested in other instances. Even though the functionality is working fine in one instance there may be chance of it not working or breaking the functionality in another instance .</p>\n\n<p>Example:&nbsp;Next action date column is added in all forms, it is working fine in all forms in Vantage Agora, Pierian and Chemizol organization, but when we click on the&nbsp;tickets module in Chemizol organization, the functionality was looking weird because of an&nbsp;extra column: &quot;check Box&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So whenever a new functionality is introduced and&nbsp;regression testing is done, it should also be tested across all organizations.</p>\n\n<p>If the new requirements are given to developer, the&nbsp;developer firstly has to fix it accordingly. It then&nbsp;has to be assigned to the tester, who&nbsp;has to test the functionality thoroughly in the initial round and report to the developer if they are facing any issue.&nbsp;Even after fixing the issue, it will then be assigned to the QA. The QA&nbsp;has to test the functionality again and&nbsp;if the same issue persists again it is said that developer has to lose the kra.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Example 2:&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>These are the possible&nbsp;scenarios to test Email notifications:</p>\n\n<p>1) Put switch On to both Assigned and owner of form and send comments.</p>\n\n<p>2) Put switch On to owner and Off to Assigned person&nbsp;and send comments.</p>\n\n<p>3) Put switch Off to owner and On to Assigned person.</p>\n\n<p>4) Put switch Off to both user.</p>\n\n<p>5) Put switch Off to both user and login with third user whose switch is On.</p>\n\n<p>6)&nbsp;Put switch Off to both user and login with third user whose switch is Off.</p>\n\n<h2>Example 3:&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Functional testing example:</p>\n\n<p>1) Initially when the QA starts testing the functionality one has to make sure if its related to admin functionality has to test&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2) When the ticket is raised give the snapshot related to admin in the same ticket.</p>\n\n<p>This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the way QA should test admin as well.</p>\n\n<p>The tester should also cross check other tester functionality.</p>\n\n<h2>Example 4:&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond testing to purpose:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a parent ticket for each release and each group (Category):&nbsp;</strong>Initially, one has to create a ticket which is considered to be the parent. When further&nbsp;tickets are raised, these should be linked to the parent. As a result, one can keep track of the bugs and work accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Custom list view</strong>: One has to make sure they create a custom list view of all tickets for each release.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a ticket based on the priority level</strong>: One has to make sure to create a ticket if it&#39;s of a major functional bug or instead, create it in the&nbsp;form of a&nbsp;requirement. In addition,&nbsp;one has to list out all the minor functional bugs in the same ticket&nbsp;or they can be linked to the parent ticket.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tickets outside: </strong>&nbsp;There should be no tickets outside the release tickets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>At the end of release: O</strong>ne should have a total count of bugs -&nbsp;how many bugs have been&nbsp;raised and out of those, how many have been&nbsp;fixed/closed, how many have not been&nbsp;fixed, how many have been&nbsp;re-assigned back to developer and so on - this is done&nbsp;for each release. The bugs which are not fixed are&nbsp;to be included in the new release by deleting/closing all the bugs which have been&nbsp;fixed.</p>\n\n<h2>Useful Links</h2>\n\n<p>Yes. some of these links are outdated (or jumbled up) but they have been maintained here for tracking the progress the team has made in all these years.</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"1\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/37361\" target=\"_blank\">Product Release Management</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/209116\" target=\"_blank\">Use case description template</a></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/334155\" target=\"_blank\">SDLC Guidelines</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/208373\" target=\"_blank\">Smoke Tests Process</a></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/listview/formid/127/moduleid/15/type/apps\" target=\"_blank\">Dev tickets</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/250500\" target=\"_blank\">Development&nbsp;backlog</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/208373\" target=\"_blank\">Smoke Test Dev-Ops Tracker</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/652\" target=\"_blank\">Smoke Test QA Tracker</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/255453\" target=\"_blank\">SDLC Tracker</a></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/98053\" target=\"_blank\">Product tickets audit</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/56207\" target=\"_blank\">Red tasks audit</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.eoxvantage.com/public/employee/module/view/instanceformid/352932\" target=\"_blank\">SDLC&nbsp;audit</a></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h1>Template Test Case</h1>\n\n<p>I know you didn&#39;t like Software Engineering as a subject.
